### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?

A real world example of virtualization is the Amazon marketplace where people can buy things from Amazon or other
sources. A person purchase anything from Amazon and it can come from a variety of places such as an Amazon warehouse
or someone's home. Abstractly there is an illusion that Amazon is some physical place that has nearly every product
while in reality the products you get can be quite spread out and come from many different warehouses.

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?

A process is a software object that represents a specific portion of a running program and isolates each running program from others.
A process runs a program.

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction?

The primary purpose of process abstraction is for isolation so that programmers do not have to think about every possible interaction.

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?

Process abstraction creates the illusion that all these processes are isolated and separate from each other. This allows people to
multi task and switch between processes, feel that each process has its own memory, and work on one device that must in reality
be controlling and communicating with many different processes at once.

5. What is the kernel?

The kernel is the part of the operating system responsible for core capabilities like creating threads.

6. What is a daemon?

A daemon is a process that runs in the background and provides operating system services.
